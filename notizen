Using pdb (Python Debugger)
The pdb module in Python allows you to run your script in debugging mode from the console.
To use pdb:
 
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

You can insert the following line in your script wherever you want the debugger to start, usually just before or inside the function you want to debug.
Once in the pdb prompt, you can use the following commands:

    n (next): Execute the next line.
    s (step): Step into the function.
    c (continue): Continue execution until the next breakpoint.
    p <variable>: Print the value of a variable.

Using Logging
For more advanced debugging and to keep track of different levels of information (debug, info, warning, error), you can use the logging module.
